            <p>We are a group of students who created this event management system as part of our term project. Our goal was to develop a user-friendly platform that helps users easily manage their events.</p>
            <p>This project allowed us to apply what we learned in our courses and gain practical experience in web development. We hope you find our system useful and easy to use.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting our website!</p>
